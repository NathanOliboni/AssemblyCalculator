# Assembly Calculator
## *Students Gabriel Yudi Leite Higuchi and Nathan Luiz Silva Oliboni.*

> *This project consists of implementing a calculator using assembly language that operates with floating-point numbers and includes functionalities for reading and writing data to files.*

## $Functionalities:$

- Mathematical Operations: The calculator supports basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with floating-point numbers. It can also include advanced operations such as exponentiation, square root, logarithms, etc., depending on project requirements.

- Input and Output of Data: Users can input numbers and operators through a simple interface, which can be implemented in the command line or in a graphical interface, depending on the project's complexity. The results of operations are displayed to the user.

- File Manipulation: In addition to real-time operations, the calculator is capable of saving and loading data from files. This allows users to store calculations for future reference or sharing with others. File read and write operations are implemented using assembly input/output instructions.

- Error Handling and Exceptions: The calculator includes mechanisms for handling errors during operations, such as division by zero, overflow, etc. It provides clear and precise error messages to guide the user on how to correct the issues.

## $Benefits:$

- Efficiency: Assembly code allows precise control over the underlying hardware, resulting in fast and efficient calculation operations.
Portability: The project can be adapted to different processor architectures, provided that the necessary changes are made for compatibility.

- Learning: Implementing a calculator in assembly provides students with a deeper understanding of the internal workings of computers and floating-point operations.

## $Implementation:$
> The project is implemented in assembly language, leveraging the specific instructions of the target processor architecture to perform floating-point calculations efficiently. Additionally, input/output functionalities are used to interact with the user and to read/write data to files.

## $Conclusion:$
- This assembly calculator project combines the use of floating-point numbers with file manipulation, providing a valuable practical and educational experience for students. It not only reinforces theoretical concepts learned in the classroom but also develops low-level programming skills and problem-solving abilities.
